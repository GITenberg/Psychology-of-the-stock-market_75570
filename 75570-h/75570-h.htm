<h2 class="nobreak" id="IThe_Speculative_Cycle">I—The Speculative Cycle</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Most</span> experienced professional
traders in the stock market will
readily admit that the minor
fluctuations, amounting to perhaps five
or ten dollars a share in the active
speculative issues, are chiefly psychological.
They result from varying attitudes
of the public mind, or, more
strictly, from the mental attitudes of
those persons who are interested in the
market at the time.</p>

<p>Such fluctuations may be, and often
are, based on “fundamental” conditions—that
is, on real changes in the
dividend prospects of the stocks affected
or on variations in the earning
power of the corporations represented—and
again they may not. The broad
movements of the market, covering
periods of months or even years, are
always the result of general financial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
conditions; but the smaller intermediate
fluctuations represent changes in
the state of the public mind, which
may or may not coincide with alterations
in basic factors.</p>

<p>To bring out clearly the degree to
which psychology enters into the stock
market problem from day to day, it is
only necessary to reproduce a conversation
between professional traders
such as may be heard almost any day
in New street or in the neighboring
cafés.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you know?” says one
trader to the other.</p>

<p>“Just covered my Steel,” is the reply.
“Too much company. Everybody
seems to be short.”</p>

<p>“Everybody I’ve seen thinks just as
you do. Each one has covered because
he thinks everybody else is short—still
the market doesn’t rally much.
I don’t believe there’s much short interest
left, and if that’s the case we
shall get another break.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what they all say—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
they’ve all sold short again because
they think everybody else has covered.
I believe there’s just as much short
interest now as there was before.”</p>

<p>It is evident that this series of inversions
might be continued indefinitely.
These alert mental acrobats are doing
a succession of flip-flops, each one of
which leads up logically to the next,
without ever arriving at a final stopping-place.</p>

<p>The main point of their argument is
that the state of mind of a man short
of the market is radically different from
the state of mind of one who is long.
Their whole study, in such a conversation,
is the mental attitude of those interested
in the market. If a majority
of the volatile class of in-and-out traders
are long, many of them will hasten
to sell on any sign of weakness and
a decline will result. If the majority
are short, they will buy on any development
of strength and an advance may
be expected.</p>

<p>The psychological aspects of speculation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
may be considered from two points
of view, equally important. One question
is, What effect do varying mental
attitudes of the public have upon the
course of prices? How is the character
of the market influenced by psychological
conditions?</p>

<p>A second consideration is, How does
the mental attitude of the individual
trader affect his chances of success?
To what extent, and how, can he overcome
the obstacles placed in his pathway
by his own hopes and fears, his
timidities and his obstinacies?</p>

<p>These two points of view are so
closely involved and intermingled that
it is almost impossible to consider
either one alone. It will be necessary
to take up first the subject of speculative
psychology as a whole, and later
to attempt to draw conclusions both
as to its effects upon the market and
its influence upon the fortunes of the
individual trader.</p>

<p>As a convenient starting point it may
be well to trace briefly the history of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
the typical speculative cycle, which
runs its course over and over, year after
year, with infinite slight variations but
with substantial similarity, on every
stock exchange and in every speculative
market of the world—and presumably
will continue to do so as long as
prices are fixed by the competition of
buyers and sellers, and as long as human
beings seek a profit and fear a loss.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Beginning with a condition of dullness
and inactivity, with small fluctuations
and very slight public interest,
prices begin to rise, at first almost imperceptibly.
No special reason appears
for the advance, and it is generally
thought to be merely temporary, due to
small professional operations. There
is, of course, some short interest in the
market, mostly, at this time, of the
character sometimes called a “sleeping”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
short interest. An active speculative
stock is never entirely free from shorts.</p>

<p>As there is so little public speculation
at this period in the cycle, there
are but few who are willing to sell out
on so small an advance, hence prices
are not met by any large volume of
profit-taking. The smaller professionals
take the short side for a turn,
with the idea that trifling fluctuations
are the best that can be hoped for at
the moment and must be taken advantage
of if any profits are to be secured.
This class of selling brings prices back
almost to their former dead level.</p>

<p>Soon another unostentatious upward
movement begins, carrying prices a
trifle higher than the first. A few
shrewd traders take the long side, but
the public is still unmoved and the
sleeping short interest—most of it originally
put out at much higher figures—still
refuses to waken.</p>

<p>Gradually prices harden further and
finally advance somewhat sharply. A
few of the more timid shorts cover, perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
to save a part of their profits or
to prevent their trades from running
into a loss. The fact that a bull turn
is coming now penetrates through another
layer of intellectual density and
another wave of traders take the long
side. The public notes the advance and
begins to think some further upturn
is possible, but that there will be plenty
of opportunities to buy on substantial
reactions.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, these reactions, except
of the most trifling character, do
not appear. Waiting buyers do not get
a satisfactory chance to take hold.
Prices begin to move up faster. There
is a halt from time to time, but when
a real reaction finally comes the market
looks “too weak to buy,” and when it
starts up again it often does so with a
sudden leap that leaves would-be purchasers
far in the rear.</p>

<p>At length the more stubborn bears
become alarmed and begin to cover in
large volume. The market “boils,” and
to the short who is watching the tape,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
seems likely to shoot through the ceiling
at almost any moment. However
firm may be his bearish convictions, his
nervous system eventually gives out under
this continual pounding, and he
covers everything “at the market” with
a sigh of relief that his losses are no
greater.</p>

<p>About this time the outside public
begins to reach the conclusion that the
market is “too strong to react much,”
and that the only thing to do is to “buy
’em anywhere.” From this source
comes another wave of buying, which
soon carries prices to new high levels,
and purchasers congratulate themselves
on their quick and easy profits.</p>

<p>For every buyer there must be a
seller—or, more accurately, for every
one hundred shares bought one hundred
shares must be sold, as the actual number
of <em>persons</em> buying at this stage is
likely to be much greater than the number
of <em>persons</em> selling. Early in the
advance the supply of stocks is small
and comes from scattered sources, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
as prices rise, more and more holders
become satisfied with their profits and
willing to sell. The bears, also, begin
to fight the advance by selling short
on every quick rise. A stubborn professional
bear will often be forced to
cover again and again, with a small
loss each time, before he finally locates
the top and secures a liberal profit on
the ensuing decline.</p>

<p>Those selling at this stage are not,
as a rule, the largest holders. The largest
holders are usually those whose
judgment is sound enough, or whose
connections are good enough, so that
they have made a good deal of money;
and neither a sound judgment nor the
best advisers are likely to favor selling
so early in the advance, when much
larger profits can be secured by simply
holding on.</p>

<p>The height to which prices can now
be carried depends on the underlying
conditions. If money is easy and general
business prosperous a prolonged
bull movement may result, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
strained banking resources or depressed
trade will set a definite limit to the
possible advance. If conditions are
bearish, the driving of the biggest
shorts to cover will practically end the
rise; but in a genuine bull market the
advance will continue until checked by
sales of stocks held for investment,
which come upon the market only
when prices are believed to be unduly
high.</p>

<p>In a sense, the market is always a
contest between investors and speculators.
The real investor, looking chiefly
to interest return, but by no means unwilling
to make a profit by buying low
and selling high, is ready, perhaps, to
buy his favorite stock at a price which
will yield him six per cent. on his investment,
or to sell at a price yielding
only four per cent. The speculator
cares nothing about interest return.
He wants to buy before prices go up
and to sell short before they go down.
He would as soon buy at the top of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
big rise at any other time, provided prices
are going still higher.</p>

<p>As the market advances, therefore,
one investor after another sees his limit
reached and his stock sold. Thus the
volume of stocks to be carried or tossed
from hand to hand by bullish speculators
is constantly rolling up like a
snowball. On the ordinary intermediate
fluctuations, covering five to
twenty dollars a share, these sales by
investors are small compared with the
speculative business. In one hundred
shares of a stock selling at 150, the
investor has $15,000; but with this sum
the speculator can easily carry ten
times that number of shares.</p>

<p>The reason why sales by investors
are so effective is not because of the
actual amount of stock thrown on the
market, but because this stock is a permanent
load, which will not be got
rid of again until prices have suffered
a severe decline. What the speculator
sells he or some other trader may buy
back tomorrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>The time comes when everybody
seems to be buying. Prices become
confused. One stock leaps upward in
a way to strike terror to the heart of
the last surviving short. Another appears
almost equally strong, but slips
back unobtrusively when nobody is
looking, like the frog jumping out of
the well in the arithmetic of our boyhood.
Still another churns violently in
one place, like a side-wheeler stuck on
a sand-bar.</p>

<p>Then the market gives a sudden
lurch downward, as though in danger
of spilling out its unwieldy contents.
This is hailed as a “healthy reaction,”
though it is a mystery whom it can be
healthy for, unless it is the shorts.
Prices recover again, with everybody
happy except a few disgruntled bears,
who are rightly regarded with contemptuous
amusement.</p>

<p>Curiously, however, there seems to
be stock enough for all comers, and
the few cranks who have time to
bother with such things notice that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
the general average of prices is now
rising very slowly, if at all. The largest
speculative holders of stocks, finding
a market big enough to absorb
their sales, are letting go. And there
are always stocks enough to go around.
Our big capitalists are seldom entirely
out of stocks. They merely have more
stocks when prices are low and fewer
when prices are high. Moreover, long
before there is any danger of the supply
running out, plenty of new issues
are created.</p>

<p>When there is a general public interest
in the stock market, an immense
amount of realizing will often be absorbed
within three or four days or a
week, after which the deluge; but if
speculation is narrow, prices may remain
around top figures for weeks or
months, while big holdings are fed out,
a few hundred shares here and a few
hundred there, and even then a balance
may be left to be thrown over on
the ensuing decline at whatever prices
can be obtained. Great speculative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
leaders are far from infallible. They
have often sold out too soon and later
have seen the market run away to unexpected
heights, or have held on too
long and have suffered severe losses
before they could get out.</p>

<p>In this selling the bull leaders get a
good deal of undesired help from the
bears. However wary the bulls may
be in concealing their sales, their machinations
will be discovered by watchful
professionals and shrewd chart students,
and a considerable sprinkling of
short sales will be put out within a
few points of the top. This is one of
the reasons why the long swings in
active speculative stocks are smaller
in proportion to price than in inactive
specialties of a similar character—contrary
to the generally received impression.
It is rare that any considerable
short interest exists in the inactive
stocks.</p>

<p>Once the top-heavy load is overturned,
the decline is usually more
rapid than the previous advance. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
floating supply, now greatly increased,
is tossed about from one speculator to
another at lower and lower prices.
From time to time stocks become temporarily
lodged in stubborn hands, so
that part of the shorts take fright and
cover, causing a sharp upturn; but so
long as the load of stocks is still on
the market the general course of prices
must be downward.</p>

<p>Until investors or big speculative
capitalists again come into the market,
the load of stocks to be carried by ordinary
speculative bulls increases almost
continually. There is no lessening
of the floating supply of stock certificates
in the Street, and there is a
gradual increase in the short interest;
and of course the bulls have to carry
these short sales as well as the actual
certificates, since for every seller there
must be a buyer, whether the sale be
made by a short or a long. Shorts
cover again and again on the sharp
breaks, but in most cases they put out
their lines again, either higher or lower,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
as opportunity offers. On the average,
the short interest is largest at low
prices, though there are likely to be
periods during the decline when it will
be larger than at the final bottom,
where buying by shorts often helps to
avert panicky conditions.</p>

<p>The length of this decline, like the
extent of the preceding advance, depends
on fundamental conditions; for
both investors and speculative capitalists
will come into the market sooner
if all conditions are favorable than they
will in a stringent money market or
when the future prospects of business
are unsatisfactory. As a rule, buyers
do not appear in force until a “bargain
day” appears. This is when, in its
downward course, the heavy load of
stocks strikes an area honeycombed
with stop loss orders. Floor traders
seize the opportunity to put out short
lines and a general collapse results.</p>

<p>Here are plenty of stocks to be had
cheap, and shrewd operators—large
and small, but mostly large or on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
way to become so—are busy picking
them up. The fixed limits of many investors
are also reached by the sharp
break, and their purchases disappear,
to be seen in the Street no more until
the next bull turn.</p>

<p>Many shorts cover on such a break,
but not all. The sequel to the “bargain
day” is a big short interest which
has overstayed its market, and a quick
rally follows; but when the more
urgent shorts get relief, prices sag
again and fall into that condition of
lethargy from which this consideration
of the speculative cycle started.</p>

<p>The movements described are substantially
uniform, whether the cycle
be one covering a week, a month, or a
year. The big cycle includes many
intermediate movements, and these
movements in turn contain smaller
swings. Investors do not participate to
any extent in the small swings, but otherwise
the forces involved in a three-point
turn up and down are substantially the
same as those which appear in a thirty-point<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
cycle, though not so easy to identify.</p>

<p>The fact will at once be recognized
that the above description is, in essence,
a story of human hopes and
fears; of a mental attitude, on the part
of those interested, resulting from their
own position in the market, rather than
from any deliberate judgment of conditions;
of an unwarranted projection
by the public imagination of a perceived
present into an unknown though not
wholly unknowable future.</p>

<p>Laying aside for the present the influence
of fundamental conditions on
prices, it is our task to trace out both
the causes and the effects of these
psychological elements in speculation.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> is hard for the average man to oppose
what appears to be the general
drift of public opinion. In the
stock market this is perhaps harder
than elsewhere; for we all realize that
the prices of stocks must, in the long
run, be controlled by public opinion.
The point we fail to remember is that
public opinion in a speculative market
is measured in dollars, not in population.
One man controlling one million
dollars has double the weight of five
hundred men with one thousand dollars
each. Dollars are the horse-power
of the markets—the mere number of
men does not signify.</p>

<p>This is why the great body of opinion
appears to be bullish at the top and
bearish at the bottom. The multitude
of small traders must be, as a plain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
necessity, long when prices are at the
top, and short or out of the market at
the bottom. The very fact that they
<em>are</em> long at the top shows that they
have been supplied with stocks from
some source.</p>

<p>Again, the man with one million dollars
is a silent individual. The time
when it was necessary for him to talk
is past—his money now does the talking.
But the one thousand men who
have one thousand dollars each are
conversational, fluent, verbose to the
last degree; and among these smaller
traders are the writers—the newspaper
and news bureau men, and the manufacturers
of gossip for brokerage
houses.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the above
course of reasoning leads us to the conclusion
that most of those who write
and talk about the market are more
likely to be wrong than right, at least
so far as speculative fluctuations are
concerned. This is not complimentary
to the “moulders of public opinion,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
but most seasoned newspaper readers
will agree that it is true. The press
reflects, in a general way, the thoughts
of the multitude, and in the stock market
the multitude is necessarily, as a
logical deduction from the facts of the
case, likely to be bullish at high prices
and bearish at low.</p>

<p>It has often been remarked that the
average man is an optimist regarding
his own enterprises and a pessimist regarding
those of others. Certainly this
is true of the professional trader in
stocks. As a result of the reasoning
outlined above, he comes habitually to
expect that nearly every one else will
be wrong, but is, as a rule, confident
that his own analysis of the situation
will prove correct. He values the opinions
of a few persons whom he believes
to be generally successful; but
aside from these few, the greater the
number of the bullish opinions he
hears, the more doubtful he becomes
about the wisdom of following the bull
side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>This apparent contrariness of the
market, although easily understood
when its causes are analyzed, breeds
in professional traders a peculiar sort
of skepticism—leads them always to
distrust the obvious and to apply a
kind of inverted reasoning to almost
all stock market problems. Often, in
the minds of traders who are not naturally
logical, this inverted reasoning
assumes the most erratic and grotesque
forms, and it accounts for many
apparently absurd fluctuations in prices
which are commonly charged to manipulation.</p>

<p>For example, a trader starts with
this assumption: The market has had
a good advance; all the small traders
are bullish; somebody must have sold
them the stock which they are carrying;
hence the big capitalists are probably
sold out or short and ready for a
reaction or perhaps for a bear market.
Then if a strong item of bullish news
comes out—one, let us say, that really
makes an important change in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
situation—he says, “Ah, so this is what
they have been bulling the market on!
It has been discounted by the previous
rise.” Or he may say, “They are putting
out this bull news to sell stocks
on.” He proceeds to sell out any long
stocks he may have or perhaps to sell
short.</p>

<p>His reasoning may be correct or it
may not; but at any rate his selling
and that of others who reason in a
similar way, is likely to produce at
least a temporary decline on the announcement
of the good news. This
decline looks absurd to the outsider
and he falls back on the old explanation,
“All manipulation.”</p>

<p>The same principle is often carried
further. You will find professional
traders reasoning that favorable figures
on the steel industry, for example,
have been concocted to enable insiders
to sell their Steel; or that gloomy reports
are put in circulation to facilitate
accumulation. Hence they may act in
direct opposition to the news and carry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
the market with them, for the time at
least.</p>

<p>The less the trader knows about the
fundamentals of the financial situation
the more likely he is to be led astray
in conclusions of this character. If he
has confidence in the general strength
of conditions he may be ready to accept
as genuine and natural, a piece of
news which he would otherwise receive
with cynical skepticism and use as a
basis for short sales. If he knows that
fundamental conditions are unsound,
he will not be so likely to interpret bad
news as issued to assist in accumulation
of stocks.</p>

<p>The same reasoning is applied to
large purchases through brokers known
to be associated with capitalists. In fact,
in this case we often hear a double inversion,
as it were. Such buying may
impress the observer in three ways:</p>

<p>1. The “rank outsider” takes it at
face value, as bullish.</p>

<p>2. A more experienced trader may
say, “If they really wished to get the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
stocks they would not buy through
their own brokers, but would endeavor
to conceal their buying by scattering
it among other houses.”</p>

<p>3. A still more suspicious professional
may turn another mental somersault
and say, “They are buying
through their own brokers so as to
throw us off the scent and make us
think someone else is using their brokers
as a blind.” By this double somersault
such a trader arrives at the same
conclusion as the outsider.</p>

<p>The reasoning of traders becomes
even more complicated when large
buying or selling is done openly by a
big professional who is known to trade
in-and-out for small profits. If he buys
50,000 shares, other traders are quite
willing to sell to him and their opinion
of the market is little influenced,
simply because they know he may sell
50,000 the next day or even the next
hour. For this reason great capitalists
sometimes buy or sell through such big
professional traders in order to execute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
their orders easily and without arousing
suspicion. Hence the play of subtle
intellects around big trading of this
kind often becomes very elaborate.</p>

<p>It is to be noticed that this inverted
reasoning is useful chiefly at the top
or bottom of a movement, when distribution
or accumulation is taking
place on a large scale. A market which
repeatedly refuses to respond to good
news after a considerable advance is
likely to be “full of stocks.” Likewise
a market which will not go down on
bad news is usually “bare of stocks.”</p>

<p>Between the extremes will be found
long stretches in which capitalists have
very little cause to conceal their position.
Having accumulated their lines
as low as possible, they are then willing
to be known as the leaders of the upward
movement and have every reason
to be perfectly open in their buying.
This condition continues until they are
ready to sell. Likewise, having sold as
much as they desire, they have no
reason to conceal their position further,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
even though a subsequent decline may
run for months or a year.</p>

<p>It is during a long upward movement
that the “lamb” makes money,
because he accepts facts as facts, while
the professional trader is often found
fighting the advance and losing heavily
because of his over-development of
cynicism and suspicion.</p>

<p>The successful trader eventually
learns when to invert his natural mental
processes and when to leave them
in their usual position. Often he
develops a sort of instinct which could
scarcely be reduced to cold print. But
in the hands of the tyro this form of
reasoning is exceedingly dangerous, because
it permits of putting an alternate
construction on any event. Bull news
either (1) is significant of a rising
trend of prices, or (2) indicates that
“they” are trying to make a market
to sell on. Bad news may indicate
either a genuinely bearish situation or
a desire to accumulate stocks at low
prices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>The inexperienced operator is therefore
left very much at sea. He is playing
with the professional’s edged tools
and is likely to cut himself. Of what
use is it for him to try to apply his
reason to stock market conditions when
every event may be doubly interpreted?</p>

<p>Indeed, it is doubtful if the professional’s
distrust of the obvious is of
much benefit to him in the long run.
Most of us have met those deplorable
mental wrecks, often found among the
“chairwarmers” in brokers’ offices,
whose thinking machinery seems to
have become permanently demoralized
as a result of continued acrobatics.
They are always seeking an “ulterior
motive” in everything. They credit—or
debit—Morgan and Rockefeller with
the smallest and meanest trickery and
ascribe to them the most artful duplicity
in matters which those “high financiers”
wouldn’t stoop to notice. The
continual reversal of the mental engine
sometimes deranges its mechanism.</p>

<p>Probably no better general rule can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
be laid down than the brief one, “Stick
to common sense.” Maintain a balanced,
receptive mind and avoid abstruse
deductions. A few further suggestions
may, however, be offered:</p>

<p>If you already have a position in
the market, do not attempt to bolster
up your failing faith by resorting to
intellectual subtleties in the interpretation
of obvious facts. If you are
long or short of the market, you are
not an unprejudiced judge, and you will
be greatly tempted to put such an interpretation
upon current events as will
coincide with your preconceived opinion.
It is hardly too much to say that
this is the greatest obstacle to success.
The least you can do is to avoid inverted
reasoning in support of your
own position.</p>

<p>After a prolonged advance, do not
call inverted reasoning to your aid in
order to prove that prices are going
still higher; likewise after a big break
do not let your bearish deductions become
too complicated. Be suspicious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
of bull news at high prices, and of bear
news at low prices.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that an item of news
usually causes but <em>one</em> considerable
movement of prices. If the movement
takes place before the news comes out,
as a result of rumors and expectations,
then it is not likely to be repeated after
the announcement is made; but if the
movement of prices has not preceded,
then the news contributes to the general
strength or weakness of the situation
and a movement of prices may
follow.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">If</span> a man entirely unfamiliar with the
stock market should spend several
days around the Exchange listening
to the conversation of all sorts of
traders and investors, in order to pick
up information about the causes of price
movements, the probability is that the
most pressing question in his mind at the
end of that time would be “Who are
‘They?’”</p>

<p>Everywhere he went he would
hear about Them. In the customers’
rooms of the fractional lot houses
he would find young men trading in
ten shares and arguing learnedly as
to what They were to do next. Tape
readers—experts and tyros alike—would
tell him that They were accumulating
Steel, or distributing Reading.
Floor traders and members of the Exchange
would whisper that they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
told They were going to put the market
up, or down, as the case might be. Even
sedate investors might inform him that,
although the situation was bearish, undoubtedly
They would have to put the
market temporarily higher in order to
unload Their stocks.</p>

<p>This “They” theory of the market is
quite as prevalent among successful
traders as among beginners—probably
more so. There may be room for argument
as to why this is so, but as to the
fact itself there is no doubt. Whether
They are a myth or a definite reality,
many persons are making money by
studying the market from this point of
view.</p>

<p>If you were to go around Wall street
and ask various classes of traders who
They are, you would get nearly as many
different answers as the number of people
interviewed. One would say, “The
house of Morgan”; another, “Standard
Oil and associated interests”—which is
pretty broad, when you stop to think of
it; another, “The big banking interests”;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
still another, “Professional traders on the
floor”; a fifth, “Pools in the various favorite
stocks, which act more or less in
concert”; a sixth might say, “Shrewd and
successful speculators, whoever and
wherever they are”; while to the seventh,
They may typify merely active traders
as a whole, whom he conceives to make
prices by falling over each other to buy
or to sell.</p>

<p>Indeed, one writer of no small attainments
as a student of market conditions
believes that the entire phenomena of the
New York stock market are under the
control of some one individual, who is
presumably, in some way or other, the
representative of great associated interests.</p>

<p>It seems obviously impossible to trace
to its source, tag and identify any sort
of permanent controlling power. The
stock markets of the world move pretty
much together in the broad cyclical
swings, so that such a power would have
to consist of a world-wide association of
great financial interests, controlling all of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
the principal security markets. The average
observer will find it difficult to
masticate and swallow this proposition.</p>

<p>The effort to reduce the science of
speculation and investment to an impossible
definiteness or an ideal simplicity
is, I believe, responsible for many failures.
A. S. Hardy, the diplomat, who was
formerly a professor of mathematics and
wrote books on quaternions, differential
calculus, etc., once remarked that the
study of mathematics is very poor mental
discipline, because it does not cultivate
the judgment. Given fixed and certain
premises, your mathematician will follow
them out to a correct conclusion; but in
practical affairs the whole difficulty lies
in selecting your premises.</p>

<p>So the market student of a mathematical
turn of mind is always seeking a
rule or a set of rules—a “sure thing” as
traders put it. He would not seek such
rules for succeeding in the grocery business
or the lumber business; he would,
on the contrary, analyze each situation as
it arose and act accordingly. The stock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
market presents itself to my mind as a
purely practical proposition. Scientific
methods may be applied to any line of
business, from stocks to chickens, but
this is a very different thing from trying
to reduce the fluctuations of the stock
market to a basis of mathematical certainty.</p>

<p>In discussing the identity of Them,
therefore, we must be content to take
obvious facts as we find them without
attempting to spin fine theories.</p>

<p>There are three senses in which this
idea of “Them” has some foundation in
fact. First, “They” may be and often
are roughly conceived of as the floor
traders on the Stock Exchange who are
directly concerned in making quotations,
pools formed to control certain stocks, or
individual manipulators.</p>

<p>Floor traders exercise an important influence
on the immediate movement of
prices. Suppose, for example, they observe
that offerings of Reading are very
light. Declines do not induce liquidation
and only small offerings of stock are met<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
on advances. They begin to feel that, in
the absence of unexpected cataclysms,
Reading will not decline much. The natural
thing for them to do is to begin buying
Reading on all soft spots. Whenever
a few hundred shares are offered at a
bargain, floor traders snap up the stock.</p>

<p>As a result of this “bailing out” of the
market, Reading becomes scarcer still,
and traders, being now long, become
more bullish. They begin to “mark up
prices.” This is not difficult, since they
are, for the time being, practically unanimous
in a desire for higher prices. Suppose
the market is 161⅛ bid, offered at
161¼. They find that only 100 shares
are for sale at ¼, and 200 are offered
at ⅜. As to how much stock may be
awaiting bids at ½ or higher, they cannot
be sure, but can generally make a
shrewd guess. One or more traders take
these offerings, of perhaps 500 shares,
and make the market ½ bid. The other
floor traders are not willing to sell at
this trifling profit, and a wait ensues to
see whether any outside orders are attracted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
by the movement of the price,
and if so, whether they are buying or
selling orders. If a few buying orders
come in, they are filled, perhaps at ⅝
and ¾. If selling appears, the floor
traders retire in good order, take the
offerings at lower prices, and try it again
the next day or perhaps the next hour.
Eventually, by seizing every favorable
opportunity, they engineer an upward
move of perhaps two or three points
without taking any more stock than they
want.</p>

<p>If such a movement attracts a following,
it may easily run ten points without
any real change in the prospects of the
Reading road—though the prospects of
the road may have had something to do
with making the stock scarce before the
movement started. On the other hand,
if large offerings of stock are encountered
at the advance, the boomlet is
ignominiously squelched and the floor
traders make trifling profits or losses.</p>

<p>Pools are not so common as most outsiders
believe. There are many difficulties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
and complications to be overcome before
a pool can be formed, held together,
and operated successfully, as we had ample
opportunity to observe not long ago
in the case of Hocking Coal &amp; Iron.
But if a definite pool exists in any stock,
its operations are practically a reproduction,
on a larger scale and under a binding
agreement, of the methods employed
by floor traders over a smaller range and
in a mere loose and voluntary association
resulting from their common interests.
And the individual manipulator is
only a pool consisting of one person.</p>

<p>Second, many conceive “Them” as an association
of powerful capitalists who are
running a campaign in all the important
speculative stocks simultaneously. It is
safe to say that no such permanent and
united association exists, though it would
be hard to prove such a statement. But
there have been many times when a single
great interest was practically in control
of the market for a time, other interests
being content to look on, or to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
participate in a small way, or to await a
favorable chance to take the other side.</p>

<p>The “Standard Oil crowd,” the “Gates
crowd,” the “Morgan interests,” and
Harriman and his associates, will at
once occur to the reader as having been,
at various times in the past, in sole control
of an important general campaign.
At present the great interests are generally
classified into three divisions—Morgan,
Standard Oil, and Kuhn-Loeb.</p>

<p>A definite agreement among such interests
as these would be impossible, except
for limited and temporary purposes.
This is perhaps not so much because
these high financiers couldn’t trust each
other, as it is because each so-called interest
consists of a loosely bound aggregation
of followers of all sorts and varieties,
having only one thing in common—control
of capital. Such an “interest”
is not an army, where the traitor
can be court-martialed and shot; it is
a mob, and has to be led, not driven.
True, the known traitor might be put to
death, financially speaking, but in stock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
market operations the traitor cannot, as
a rule, be known. Unless his operations
are of unusual size, he can successfully
cover his tracks.</p>

<p>From this second point of view,
“They” are not always active in the market.
Great campaigns can only be undertaken
with safety in periods when the
future is to a certain extent assured. When
the future is in doubt, when various
confusing elements enter into the financial
and political situation, leading financiers
may be quite content to confine
their stock market operations to individual
deals, and to postpone the inauguration
of a broad campaign until a more
solid foundation exists for it.</p>

<p>Third, “They” may be conceived simply
as speculators and investors in
general—all that miscellaneous and
heterogeneous troop of persons, scattered
over the whole world, each of
whom contributes his mite to the fluctuations
of prices on the Stock Exchange.
In this sense there is no doubt about the
existence of Them, and They are the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
court of last resort in the establishment
of prices. To put it another way, these
are the “They” who are the ultimate consumers
of securities. It is to Them that
everybody else is planning, sooner or
later, directly or indirectly, to sell his
stocks.</p>

<p>You can lead the horse to water, but
you can’t make him drink. You or I or
any other great millionaire can put up
prices, but you can’t make Them buy the
stocks from you, unless They have the
purchasing power and the purchasing
disposition. So there is no doubt that
here, at any rate, we have a conception
of Them which will stand analysis without
exploding.</p>

<p>In cases where a general campaign is
being conducted, the “They” theory of
values is of considerable help in the accumulation
or distribution of stocks. In
fact, in the late stages of a bull campaign
the argument most frequently heard is
likely to be something as follows: “Yes,
prices are high and I can’t see that future
prospects are especially bullish—but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
stocks are in strong hands and They
will have to put them higher to make
a market to sell on.” Some investors
make a point of dumping over all their
stocks as soon as this veteran war-horse
of the news brigade is groomed and trotted
out. Likewise, after a prolonged
bear campaign, we hear that somebody
is “in trouble” and that They are going
to break the market until certain concentrated
holdings are brought out.</p>

<p>All this is very likely to be nothing
but dust thrown in the eyes of that most
gullible of all created beings—the haphazard
speculator. When prices are so
high in comparison with conditions that
no sound reason can be advanced why
they should go higher, a certain number
of people are still induced to buy because
of what They are going to do. Or,
at least, if the public can no longer be
induced to buy in any large volume, it is
prevented from selling short for fear of
what They may do.</p>

<p>The close student of the technical condition
of the market—by which is meant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
the character of the long and short interests
from day to day—is pretty sure to
base his operations to a considerable extent
on what he thinks They will do
next. He has in mind Them as described
in the first classification above—floor
traders, pools and manipulators.
He gets a good deal of help from this
conception, crude as it may appear to
be—largely, no doubt, because it serves
to distract his mind from current news
and gossip, and to prevent him from
being too greatly influenced by the momentary
appearance of the market.</p>

<p>When the market looks weakest, when
the news is at the worst, when bearish
prognostications are most general, is the
time to buy, as every schoolboy knows;
but if a man has in mind a picture of a
flood of stocks pouring out from the four
quarters of the globe, with no buyers,
because of some desperately bad news
which is just coming over the ticker, it
is almost a mental impossibility for him
to get up the courage to plunge in and
buy. If, on the other hand, he conceives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
that They are just giving the market a
final smash to facilitate covering a gigantic
line of short stocks, he has courage
to buy. His view may be right or
wrong, but at least he avoids buying at
the top and selling at the bottom, and he
has nerve to buy a weak market and sell
a strong one.</p>

<p>The reason for the haziness of the
“They” conception in the average trader’s
mind is that he is only concerned
with Them as They manifest Themselves
through the stock market. As to who
They are he feels a mild and detached
curiosity; but as to Their manifestations
in the market he is vitally and financially
interested. It is on the latter point,
therefore, that he concentrates his
thoughts.</p>

<p>But inasmuch as definite, painstaking
analysis of a situation is always better
than a hazy general notion of it, the
trader or investor would do much better
to rid his mind of Them. The word
“They” means nothing until it has an
antecedent; and to use it continually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
without having any antecedent in mind
is slipshod language, which stands for
slipshod thinking. They, in the sense
of the big banking interests, may be
working directly against Them in the
sense of individual manipulators; the
manipulator, again, may be trying to trap
Them in the sense of floor traders.</p>

<p>A genuine knowledge of the technical
condition of the market cannot be
summed up in any offhand declaration
about what They are going to do. You
cannot determine the attitude toward the
market of every individual who is interested
in it, but you can roughly classify
the sources from which buying and selling
are likely to come, the motives which
are likely to actuate the various classes,
and the character of the long interest and
short interest. In brief, after enough
study and observation, you can always
have in mind some kind of an antecedent
for Them, and must have it, if you base
your operations on technical conditions.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> is axiomatic that inexperienced
traders and investors, and indeed a
majority of the more experienced as
well, are continually trying to speculate
on past events. Suppose, for example,
railroad earnings as published are showing
constant large increases in net. The
novice reasons, “Increased earnings mean
increased amounts applicable to the payment

will continue, and our whole scheme of
life is necessarily based to a great degree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
on this assumption. When the price of
wheat is high farmers increase their
acreage because wheat-growing pays
better; when it is low they plant less.
I remember talking with a potato-raiser
who claimed that he had made a good
deal of money by simply reversing the
above custom. When potatoes were low
he had planted liberally; when high he
had cut down his acreage—because he
reasoned that other farmers would do
just the opposite.</p>

<p>The average man is not blessed—or
cursed, however you may look at it—with
an analytical mind. We see “as
through a glass darkly.” Our ideas are
always enveloped in a haze and our
reasoning powers work in a rut from
which we find it painful if not impossible
to escape. Many of our emotions and
some of our acts are merely automatic
responses to external stimuli. Wonderful
as is the development of the human
brain, it originated as an enlarged ganglion,
and its first response is still practically
that of the ganglion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>A simple illustration of this is found
in the enmity we all feel toward the alarm
clock which arouses us in the morning.
We have carefully set and wound that
alarm and if it failed to go off it would
perhaps put us to serious inconvenience;
yet we reward the faithful clock with
anathemas.</p>

<p>When a subway train is delayed nine-tenths
of the people waiting on the platforms
are anxiously craning their necks
to see if it is coming, while many persons
on it who are in danger of missing an
engagement are holding themselves tense,
apparently in the effort to help the train
along. As a rule we apply more well-meant,
but to a great extent ineffective,
energy, physical or nervous, to the accomplishment
of an object, than analysis
or calculation.</p>

<p>When it comes to so complicated a
matter as the price of stocks, our haziness
increases in proportion to the difficulty
of the subject and our ignorance
of it. From reading, observation and
conversation we imbibe a miscellaneous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
assortment of ideas from which we conclude
that the situation is bullish or
bearish. The very form of the expression
“the situation is bullish”—not “the
situation will soon become bullish”—shows
the extent to which we allow the
present to obscure the future in the
formation of our judgment.</p>

<p>Catch any trader and pin him down to
it and he will readily admit that the
logical moment for the highest prices is
when the news is most bullish; yet you
will find him buying stocks on this news
after it comes out—if not at the moment,
at any rate “on a reaction.”</p>

<p>Most coming events cast their shadows
before, and it is on this that intelligent
speculation must be based. The movement
of prices in anticipation of such
an event is called “discounting,” and this
process of discounting is worthy a little
careful examination.</p>

<p>The first point to be borne in mind is
that some events cannot be discounted,
even by the supposed omniscience of the
great banking interests—which is in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
point of fact, more than half imaginary.
The San Francisco earthquake is the
standard example of an event which
could not be foreseen and therefore
could not be discounted; but an event
does not have to be purely an “act of
God” to be undiscountable. There can
be no question that our great bankers
have been as much in the dark in regard
to some recent Supreme Court decisions
as the smallest “piker” in the customers’
room of an odd-lot brokerage house.</p>

<p>If the effect of an event does not make
itself felt before the event takes place, it
must come after. In all discussion of
discounting we must bear this fact in
mind in order that our subject may not
run away with us.</p>

<p>On the other hand an event may sometimes
be overdiscounted. If the dividend
rate on a stock is to be raised from
four to five per cent., earnest bulls, with
an eye to their own commitments, may
spread rumors of six or seven per cent.,
so that the actual declaration of five per<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
cent. may be received as disappointing
and cause a decline.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, every event which
is under the control of capitalists associated
with the property, or any financial
condition which is subject to the
management of combined banking interests,
is likely to be pretty thoroughly
discounted before it occurs. There is
never any lack of capital to take advantage
of a sure thing, even though it
may be known in advance to only a few
persons.</p>

<p>The extent to which future business
conditions are known to “insiders” is,
however, usually overestimated. So
much depends, especially in America,
upon the size of the crops, the temper of
the people, and the policies adopted by
leading politicians, that the future of
business becomes a very complicated
problem. No power can drive the American
people. Any control over their action
has to be exercised by cajolery or
by devious and circuitous methods.</p>

<p>Moreover, public opinion is becoming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
more volatile and changeable year by
year, owing to the quicker spread of information
and the rapid multiplication of
the reading public. One can easily
imagine that some of our older financiers
must be saying to themselves, “If I had
only had my present capital in 1870, or
else had the conditions of 1870 to work
on today!”</p>

<p>A fair idea of when the discounting
process will be completed may usually be
formed by studying conditions from
every angle. The great question is,
when will the buying or selling become
most general and urgent? In 1907, for
example, the safest and best time to buy
the sound dividend-paying stocks was
on the Monday following the bank statement
which showed the greatest decrease
in reserves. The markets opened down
several points under pressure of liquidation,
and standard issues never sold so
low afterward. The simple explanation
was that conditions had become so bad
that they could not get any worse without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
utter ruin, which all parties must and
did unite to prevent.</p>

<p>Likewise in the Presidential campaign
of 1900, the lowest prices were made on
Bryan’s nomination. Everyone said at
once, “He can’t be elected.” Therefore
his nomination was the worst that could
happen—the point of time where the
political news became most intensely
bearish. As the campaign developed his
defeat became more and more certain,
and prices continued to rise in accordance
with the general economic and financial
conditions of the period.</p>

<p>It is not the discounting of an event
thus known in advance to capitalists, that
presents the greatest difficulties, but
cases where considerable uncertainty
exists, so that even the clearest mind and
the most accurate information can result
only in a balancing of probabilities, with
the scale perhaps inclined to a greater or
less degree in one direction or the other.</p>

<p>In some cases the uncertainty which
precedes such an event is more depressing
than the worst that can happen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
afterward. An example is a Supreme
Court decision upon a previously undetermined
public policy which has kept
business men so much in the dark that
they feared to go ahead with any important
plans. This was the case at the
time of the Northern Securities decision
in 1904. “Big business” could easily
enough adjust itself to either result. It
was the uncertainty that was bearish.
Hence the decision was practically discounted
in advance, no matter what it
might prove to be.</p>

<p>This was not true to the same extent
of the Standard Oil and American Tobacco
decisions of 1911, because those
decisions were an earnest of more
trouble to come. The decisions were
greeted by a temporary spurt of activity,
based on the theory that the removal of
uncertainty was the important thing; but
a sensational decline started soon after
and was not checked until the announcement
that the Government would prosecute
the United States Steel Corporation.
This was deemed the worst that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
could happen for some time to come, and
was followed by a considerable advance.</p>

<p>More commonly, when an event is uncertain
the market estimates the chances
with considerable nicety. Each trader
backs his own opinion, strongly if he
feels confident, moderately if he still has
a few doubts which he cannot down.
The result of these opposing views may
be stationary prices, or a market fluctuating
nervously within a narrow range, or
a movement in either direction, greater
or smaller in proportion to the more or
less emphatic preponderance of the buying
or selling.</p>

<p>Of course it must always be remembered
that it is the dollars that count,
not the number of buyers or sellers. A
few great capitalists having advance information
which they regard as accurate,
may more than counterbalance thousands
of small traders who hold an opposite
opinion. In fact, this is a condition very
frequently seen, as explained in a previous
chapter.</p>

<p>Even the operations of an individual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
investor usually have an effect on prices
pretty accurately adjusted to his opinions.
When he believes prices are low
and everything favors an upward movement,
he will strain his resources in
order to accumulate as heavy a load of
securities as he can carry. After a fair
advance, if he sees the development of
some factor which <em>might</em> cause a decline—though
he doesn’t really believe it will—he
thinks it wise to lighten his load
somewhat and make sure of some of his
accumulated profits. Later when he
feels that prices are “high enough,” he
is a liberal seller; and if some danger
appears while the level of quoted values
continues high, he “cleans house,” to be
ready for whatever may come. Then if
what he considers an unwarranted speculation
carries prices still higher, he is
very likely to sell a few hundred shares
short by way of occupying his capital
and his mind.</p>

<p>It is, however, the variation of opinion
among different men that has the largest
influence in making the market responsive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
to changing conditions. A development
which causes one trader to lighten his
line of stocks may be regarded as harmless
or even beneficial by another, so that
he maintains his position or perhaps buys
more. Out of a world-wide mixture of
varying ideas, personalities and information
emerges the average level of
prices—the true index number of investment
conditions.</p>

<p>The necessary result of the above line
of reasoning is that not only probabilities
but even rather remote possibilities
are reflected in the market. Hardly any
event can happen of sufficient importance
to attract general attention which some
process of reasoning cannot construe as
bullish and some other process interpret
as bearish. Doubtless even our old friend
of the news columns to the effect that
“the necessary activities of a nation of
ninety million souls create and maintain
a large volume of business,” may influence
some red-blooded optimist to buy
100 Union; but the grouchy pessimist who
has eaten too many doughnuts for breakfast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
will accept the statement as an evidence
of the scarcity of real bull news
and will likely enough sell 100 Union
short on the strength of it.</p>

<p>It is the overextended speculator who
causes most of the fluctuations that look
absurd to the sober observer. It does not
take much to make a man buy when he
is short of stocks “up to his neck.” A
bit of news which he would regard as insignificant
at any other time will then
assume an exaggerated importance in his
eyes. His fears increase in geometrical
proportion to the size of his line of
stocks. Likewise the overloaded bull
may begin to “throw his stocks” on some
absurd story of a war between Honduras
and Roumania, without even stopping to
look up the geographical location of the
countries involved.</p>

<p>Fluctuations based on absurdities are
always relatively small. They are due
to an exaggerated fear of what “the
other fellow” may do. Personally, you
do not fear a war between Honduras and
Roumania; but may not the rumor be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
seized upon by the bears as an excuse
for a raid? And you have too many
stocks to be comfortable if such a break
should occur. Moreover, even if the
bears do not raid the market, will there
not be a considerable number of persons
who, like yourself, will fear such a raid,
and will therefore lighten their load of
stocks, thus causing some decline?</p>

<p>The professional trader, following this
line of reasoning to the limit, eventually
comes to base all his operations for short
turns in the market not on the facts but
on what he believes the facts will cause
others to do—or more accurately, perhaps,
on what he <em>sees</em> that the news <em>is</em>
causing others to do; for such a trader
is likely to keep his finger constantly on
the pulse of buying and selling as it
throbs on the floor of the Exchange or
as recorded on the tape.</p>

<p>The non-professional, however, will
do well not to let his mind stray too far
into the unknown territory of what others
may do. Like the “They” theory of
values, it is dangerous ground in that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
leads toward the abdication of common
sense; and after all, others may not prove
to be such fools as we think they are.
While the market is likely to discount
even a possibility, the chances are very
much against <em>our</em> being able to discount
the possibility profitably.</p>

<p>In this matter of discounting, as in
connection with most other stock market
phenomena, the most useful hint that can
be given is to avoid all efforts to reduce
the movement of prices to rules, measures,
or similarities and to analyze each case
by itself. Historical parallels are likely
to be misleading. Every situation is new,
though usually composed of familiar
elements. Each element must be weighed
by itself and the probable result of the
combination estimated. In most cases
the problem is by no means impossible,
but the student must learn to look into
the future and to consider the present
only as a guide to the future. Extreme
prices will come at the time when the
news is most emphatic and most widely
disseminated. When that point is passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
the question must always be, “What
next?”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> a previous chapter the fact has
been mentioned that one of the
greatest difficulties encountered by
the active trader is that of keeping his
mind in a balanced and unprejudiced
condition when he is heavily committed
to either the long or short side
of the market. Unconsciously to himself,
he permits his judgment to be
swayed by his hopes.</p>

<p>A former large speculator on the
Chicago Board of Trade, after being
short of the market and very bearish
on wheat for a long time, one day surprised
all his friends by covering
everything, going long a moderate
amount, and arguing violently on the
bull side. For two days he maintained
this position, but the market failed to
go up. He then turned back to the
short side, and had even more bear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
arguments at his tongue’s end than before.</p>

<p>To a certain extent he did this to
test the market, but still more to test
himself—to see whether, by changing
front and taking the other side, he
could persuade himself out of his bearish
opinions. When even this failed
to make any real change in his views,
he was reassured and was ready for
a new and more aggressive campaign
on the short side.</p>

<p>There is nothing peculiar about this
condition. While it is especially difficult
to maintain a balanced mind in
regard to commitments in the markets,
it is not easy to do so about anything
that closely touches our personal interests.
As a rule we can find plenty
of reasons for doing what we very
much want to do, and we are still more
prolific with excuses for not doing
what we don’t want to do. Most of
us change the old sophism “Whatever
is, is right” to the more directly useful
form “Whatever I want is right.”
To many readers will occur at once the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
name of a man prominent in public
life who seems very frequently to act
on this motto.</p>

<p>If Smith and Jones have a verbal
agreement, which afterwards turns out
to be greatly to Jones’ advantage,
Smith’s recollection is that it was
merely a loose understanding which
could be cancelled at any time, while
Jones remembers it to have been a
definite legal contract, perfectly enforceable
if it had only been written.
Talleyrand said that language was
given us for the purpose of concealing
thought. Likewise many seem to
think that logic was given us for the
purpose of backing up our desires.</p>

<p>Few persons are so introspective as
to be able to tell where this bias in
favor of their own interests begins and
where it leaves off. Still fewer bother
to make the effort to tell. To a great
extent we train our judgment to lend
itself to our selfish interests. The
question with us is not so much
whether we have the facts of a situation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
correctly in mind, as whether we
can “put it over.”</p>

<p>When it comes to buying and selling
stocks, there is no such thing as
“putting it over.” The market is relentless.
It cannot be budged by our
sophistries. It will respond exactly to
the forces and personalities which are
working upon it, with no more regard
for our opinions than if we couldn’t
vote. We cannot work for our own
interests as in other lines of business—we
can only fit our interests to the
facts.</p>

<p>To make the greatest success it is
necessary for the trader to forget entirely
his own position <em>in</em> the market,
his profits or losses, the relation of
present prices to the point where he
bought or sold, and to fix his thoughts
upon the position <em>of</em> the market. If
the market is going down the trader
must sell, no matter whether he has a
profit or a loss, whether he bought a
year ago or two minutes ago.</p>

<p>How far the average trader is from
attaining this point of view is quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
seen from his conversation, and it is
also true that a great deal of the literature
of speculation absolutely fails to
reach this conception.</p>

<p>“You have five points profit—you
had better take it,” advises the broker.
Perhaps so, if you know nothing about
the market; but if you understand the
market the time to take your profit is
when the upward movement shows
signs of culminating, regardless of
your own deal.</p>

<p>“Stop your losses; let your profits
run” is a saying which appeals to the
novice as the essence of wisdom. But
the whole question is <em>where</em> to stop the
losses and <em>how far</em> to let the profits
run. In other words, what is the <em>market</em>
going to do? If you can tell this
your personal losses and profits will
take care of themselves.</p>

<p>Here is a man who has done a great
deal of figuring and has proved to his
own satisfaction that seven points is
the correct profit to take in Union
Pacific, while losses should be limited
to two and one-half points. Nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
could be more foolish than these arbitrary
figures. He is trying to make
the market fit itself around his own
trades, instead of adapting his trades
to the market.</p>

<p>In any broker’s office you will notice
that a large part of the talk concerns
the profits and losses of the traders.
Brown had a profit of ten points and
then let it get away from him. “Great
Scott!” says his wise friend. “What
do you want? Aren’t you satisfied with
ten points profit?” The reply should
be, though it rarely is, “Certainly not,
if I think the market is going higher.”</p>

<p>“Get them out with a small profit,”
I once heard one broker say to another.
“If you don’t they will hang
on and take a loss. They never get
profit enough to satisfy them.” A
good policy, probably, if neither the
broker nor his customer had any real
knowledge of the market; but mere
nonsense for the trader who aims to
be in the slightest degree scientific.</p>

<p>The fact is that the more a trader
allows his mind to dwell upon his own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
position in the market the more likely
it is that his judgment will become
warped so that his mind is blind to
those considerations which do not fall
in with his preconceived opinion.</p>

<p>Until you try it, you have almost no
idea of the extent to which you may
be rendered unreasonable by the mere
fact that you are committed to one
side of the market. “In the market,
to be consistent is to be stubborn,”
some one has said; and it is true that
the man of strong will and logical intellect
is often less successful than the
more shallow and volatile observer,
who is ready to whiffle about like the
weathercock at any suspicion of a
change in the wind. This is because
the strong man has in this instance
embarked upon an enterprise where
he cannot use his natural force and determination—he
can employ only his
faculties of observation and interpretation.
Yet in the end the man of character
will be the more permanently
successful, because he will eventually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
master his subject more thoroughly
and attain a more judicial attitude.</p>

<p>The more simple-minded, after once
committing themselves to a position,
are thereafter chiefly influenced and
supported by the illusions of hope.
They bought, probably, as a result of
some bullish development. If prices
have advanced, they find that the market
“looks strong,” a good deal of encouraging
news comes out on the
tickers, and they hope for large profits.
After five points in their favor, they
hope for ten, and after ten they look
for fifteen or twenty.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if prices decline
they charge it to “manipulation,” “bear
raids,” etc., and expect an early recovery.
Much of the bear news appears
to them to be put out maliciously,
in order to cause prices to decline
further. It is not until the decline
begins to cause a painful encroachment
upon their capital that they
reach the point of saying, “If
‘they’ can depress prices like this
in the face of a bullish situation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
what is the use of fighting them? By
a flood of short sales, they can put
prices down as much as they like”—or
something of the sort.</p>

<p>Such traders are suffering merely
from youth, or lack of sound business
sense, or both. They have a considerable
period of study before them, if
they persist until they get permanently
profitable results. Most of them, of
course, do not persist.</p>

<p>A much more intelligent class, many
of whom are properly to be considered
as investors, do not allow their position
in the market to blind them so far
as current news or statistical developments
are concerned, but do permit
themselves to become biased in regard
to the most important factor of all—the
effect of a change in the price level.</p>

<p>They bought stocks in the expectation
of an improved situation. The
improved situation comes and prices
rise. Nothing serious in the way of
bear news appears. On the contrary,
bull news continues plentiful.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
Under these conditions they see no
reason for selling.</p>

<p>Yet there may be a most important
reason for selling—namely, that prices
have risen sufficiently to counterbalance
the improved situation—and they
would see and appreciate this fact if
they were in the position of an uninterested
observer.</p>

<p>One of the principal reasons why investors
of this class allow themselves
to become confused as to the influence
of the price level is because a bull
market nearly always goes unreasonably
high before it culminates. The
investor has perhaps, in several previous
instances, sold out at what he
thought was a fair price level, only to
see the public run away with the market
to a point where his profits would
have been doubled if he had held on.</p>

<p>It is in such cases that an expert
knowledge of speculation is essential.
If the investor has not this knowledge,
and cannot obtain the dependable advice
of one who has it, then he must
content himself with more moderate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
profits and forego the expectation of
getting the full benefit of the advance.
But with a fair knowledge of speculative
influences, he can fix his mind on
the development of the campaign, regardless
of his own holdings, and can
usually secure a larger profit than if
he depended merely upon ordinary
business “common sense.”</p>

<p>The mistake is made when, without
any expert knowledge of speculation,
he permits himself to hold on in
the hope of higher prices after a level
has been reached which has fairly discounted
improved business conditions.</p>

<p>Not one trader in a thousand ever
becomes so expert or so seasoned as
to entirely overcome the influence his
position in the market exerts upon his
judgment. That influence appears in
the most insidious and elusive ways.
One of the principal difficulties of the
expert is in preventing his active imagination
from causing him to see
what he is looking for just because he
is looking for it.</p>

<p>An example will make this clear.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
The expert has learned from experience,
let us say, that the appearance
of “holes” in the market is a sign of
weakness. By a “hole” is meant a
condition of the market where it suddenly
and unaccountably refuses to
take stock. A few hundred shares of
an active stock are offered for sale.
Sentiment is generally bullish, but
there is no buyer for that stock. Prices
slip quickly down half a point or a
point before buyers are found. This,
in an active stock, is unusual; and although
the price may recover, the professional
does not forget this treacherous
failure of the market to accept
moderate offerings. He considers it a
sign of an “over-bought” market.</p>

<p>Now suppose the trader has calculated
that an advance is about to culminate
and has taken the short side
in anticipation of that event. He suspects
that the market is over-bought,
but is not yet sure of it. Under these
circumstances any little dip in the
price will perhaps look to him like a
“hole,” even though under other conditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
he would not notice it or would
think nothing about it. He is looking
for the development of weakness and
there is danger that his imagination may
show him what he is looking for even
though it isn’t there!</p>

<p>The same remarks would apply to
the detection of accumulation or distribution.
If you want to see distribution
after a sharp advance, you are
very likely to see it. If you have sold
out and want to get a reaction on which
to repurchase, you will see plenty of
indications of a reaction. Indeed, it
is a sort of proverb in Wall Street that
there is no bear so bearish as a sold out
bull who wants a chance to repurchase.</p>

<p>In the study of so-called “technical”
conditions of the market, a situation
often appears which permits a double
construction. Indications of various
kinds are almost evenly balanced; some
things might be interpreted in two different
ways; and a trader not already
interested in the market would be likely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
to think it wise to stay out until
he could see his way more clearly.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances you will
find it an almost invariable rule that
the man who was long before this condition
arose will interpret technical
conditions as bullish, while the man
who was and remains short, sees plain
indications of technical weakness.
Somewhat amusing, but true.</p>

<p>In this matter of allowing the judgment
to be influenced by personal commitments,
very little of a constructive
or practically helpful nature can be
written, except the one word “Don’t.”
Yet when the investor or trader has
come to realize that he is a prejudiced
observer, he has made progress; for
this knowledge keeps him from trusting
too blindly to something which, at
the moment, he calls judgment, but
which may turn out to be simply an
unusually strong impulse of greed.</p>

<p>It has often been noted by stock market
writers that since the great public
is bearish at the bottom and bullish at
the top, it could make its fortune and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
beat the multi-millionaires at their own
game by simply reversing itself—buying
when it feels like selling and selling
when it feels like buying. Tom Lawson,
in the heyday of his publicity,
seems to have had some sort of dream
of the public selling back to Standard
Oil capitalists the stocks which it had
bought from them and thus bringing
everything to smash in a heap—the
philanthropic Thomas, doubtless, being
first properly short of the market.</p>

<p>This wrongheadedness of the public
no longer exists to the same extent as
formerly. A great number of small investors
buy and sell intelligently and
there has been a most noticeable falling
off in the gambling class of trade—much
to the satisfaction of everyone,
except, perhaps, the brokers who formerly
handled such business.</p>

<p>It remains true, nevertheless, that
the very moment when the market
looks strongest, is likely to be near the
top, and just when prices appear to
have started on a straight drop to the
zero point is usually near the bottom.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
The practical way for the investor to
use this principle is to be ready to
sell at the moment when bull sentiment
seems to be most widely distributed,
and to buy when the public in general
seem most discouraged. It is especially
important for him to bear this principle
in mind in taking profits on previous
commitments, as his own interests are
then identified with the current trend
of prices.</p>

<p>In a word, the trader or investor who
has studied the subject enough to be
reading this book, probably could
not make profits by reversing himself,
even if such a thing were
possible; but he can endeavor to hold
himself in a detached, unprejudiced
frame of mind, and to study the psychology
of the crowd, especially as it
manifests itself in the movement of
prices.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VIThe_Panic_and_the_Boom">VI—The Panic and the Boom</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Both</span> the panic and the boom are
eminently psychological phenomena.
This is not saying
that fundamental conditions do not at
times warrant sharp declines in prices
and at other times equally sharp advances.
But the panic, properly so-called,
represents a decline greater
than is warranted by conditions, usually
because of an excited state of the
public mind, accompanied by exhaustion
of resources; while the term
“boom” is used to mean an excessive
and largely speculative advance.</p>

<p>There are some special features connected
with the panic and the boom
which are worthy of separate consideration.</p>

<p>It is really astonishing what a hold
the fear of a possible panic has upon
the minds of many investors. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
memory of the events of 1907 has undoubtedly
operated greatly to lessen
the volume of speculative trade from
that time to the present (April, 1912).
Panics of equal severity have occurred
only a few times in the entire history
of the country, and the possibility of
such an outbreak in any one month is
smaller than the chance of loss on the
average investment through the failure
of the company. Yet the specter of
such a panic rises in the minds of the
inexperienced whenever they think of
buying stocks.</p>

<p>“Yes,” the investor may say, “Reading
seems to be in a very strong position,
but look where it sold in 1907—at
$70 a share!”</p>

<p>It is sometimes assumed that the
low prices in a panic are due to a sudden
spasm of fear, which comes quickly
and passes away quickly. This is not
the case. In a way, the operation of
the element of fear begins when prices
are near the top. Some cautious investors
begin to fear that the boom is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
being overdone and that a disastrous
decline must follow the excessive speculation
for the rise. They sell under
the influence of this feeling.</p>

<p>During the ensuing decline, which
may run for years, more and more
people begin to feel uneasy over business
or financial conditions, and they
liquidate their holdings. This caution
or fearfulness gradually spreads, increasing
and decreasing in waves, but
growing a little greater at each successive
swell. The panic is not a sudden
development, but is the result of causes
long accumulated.</p>

<p>The actual bottom prices of the panic
are more likely to result from necessity
than from fear. Those investors who
could be frightened out of their holdings
are likely to give up before the
bottom is reached. The lowest prices
are usually made by sales for those
whose immediate resources are exhausted.
Most of them are taken by
surprise and could raise the money necessary
to carry their stocks if they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
a little time; but in the stock market,
“time is the essence of the contract,”
and is the very thing that they cannot
have.</p>

<p>The great cause of loss in times of
panic is the failure of the investor to
keep enough of his capital in liquid
form. He becomes “tied up” in various
undertakings so that he cannot realize
quickly. He may have abundant property,
but no ready money. This condition,
in turn, results from trying to do
too much—greed, haste, excessive ambition,
an oversupply of easy confidence
as to the future.</p>

<p>It is noticeable in panic times that
a period arrives when nearly every one
thinks that stocks are low enough, yet
prices continue downward to a still
lower level. The result is that many
investors, after thinking that they have
“loaded up” near the bottom, find that
it was a false bottom, and are finally
forced to throw over their holdings on
a further decline.</p>

<p>This is due to the fact mentioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
above, that final low prices are the result
of necessities, not of opinions. In
1907, for example, every one of good
sense knew perfectly well that stocks
were selling below their value—the
trouble was that investors could not
get hold of the money with which to
buy.</p>

<p>The moral is that low prices, after
a prolonged bear period, are not in
themselves a sufficient reason for buying
stocks. The key to the situation
lies in the <em>accumulation of liquid capital</em>,
which is most quickly evidenced by a
rapid recovery of the excess of deposits
over loans in the New York clearing
house banks (excluding the trust companies,
in which loans are more varied).
This subject, however, takes us outside
our present field.</p>

<p>It is to a great extent because the
last part of the decline in a panic has
been caused not by public opinion, or
even by public fear, but by necessity,
arising from absolute exhaustion of
available funds, that the first part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
the ensuing recovery takes place without
any apparent reason.</p>

<p>Traders say, “The panic is over, but
stocks cannot go up much under such
bearish conditions as now exist.” Yet
stocks can and do go up, because they
are merely regaining the natural level
from which they were depressed by
“bankrupt sales,” as we would say in
discussing dry goods.</p>

<p>Perhaps the word “fear” has been
overworked in the discussion of stock
market psychology. It is only the very
few who actually sell their stocks under
the direct influence of the emotion
of fear. But a feeling of caution strong
enough to induce sales, or even a fixed
belief that prices must decline, constitutes
in itself a sort of modification
of fear, and has the same result so far
as prices are concerned.</p>

<p>The effect of this fear or caution in a
panic is not limited to the selling of
stocks, but is even more important in
preventing purchases. It takes far less
uneasiness to cause the intending investor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
to delay purchases than to precipitate
actual sales by holders. For
this reason, a small quantity of stock
pressed for sale in a panicky market
may cause a decline out of all proportion
to its importance. The offerings
may be small, but nobody wants them.</p>

<p>It is this factor which accounts for
the rapid recoveries which frequently
follow panics. Waiting investors are
afraid to step in front of a demoralized
market, but once the turn appears, they
fall over each other to buy.</p>

<p>The boom is in many ways the reverse
of the panic. Just as fear keeps
growing and spreading until the final
crash, so confidence and enthusiasm
keep reproducing each other on a wider
and wider scale until the result is a
sort of hilarity on the part of thousands
of men, many of them comparatively
young and inexperienced, who have
“made big money” during the long advance
in prices.</p>

<p>These imaginary millionaires appear
in a small swarm during every prolonged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
bull market, only to fall with
their wings singed as soon as prices
decline. Such speculators are, to all
practical intents and purposes, irresponsible.
It is their very irresponsibility
which has enabled them to make money
so rapidly on advancing prices. The
prudent man gets only moderate profits
in a bull market—it is the man who
trades on “shoe-string margins” who
gets the biggest benefit out of the rise.</p>

<p>When such mushroom fortunes have
accumulated, the market may fall temporarily
into the hands of these daredevil
spirits, so that almost any recklessness
is possible for the time. It is
this kind of buying which causes prices
to go higher after they are already high
enough—just as they go lower in a
panic after they are plainly seen to be
low enough.</p>

<p>When prices get above the natural
level, a well-judged short interest begins
to appear. These shorts are right,
but right too soon. In a genuine bull
market they are nearly always driven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
to cover by a further rise, which is,
from any common sense standpoint, unreasonable.
A riot of pyramided margins
drives the sane and calculating
short seller temporarily to shelter.</p>

<p>A psychological influence of a much
wider scope also operates to help a bull
market along to unreasonable heights.
Such a market is usually accompanied
by rising prices in all lines of business
and these rising prices always create,
in the minds of business men, the impression
that their various enterprises
are more profitable than is really the
case.</p>

<p>One reason for this false impression
is found in stocks of goods on hand.
Take the wholesale grocer, for example,
carrying a stock of goods which
inventories $10,000 in January, 1909.
On that date Bradstreet’s index of commodity
prices stood at 8.26. In January,
1910, Bradstreet’s index was 9.23.
If the prices of the various articles included
in this stock of groceries increased
in the same ratio as Bradstreet’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
list, and if the grocer had on
hand exactly the same things, he would
inventory them at about $11,168 in
January, 1910.</p>

<p>He made an additional profit of
$1,168 during the year without any effort,
and probably without any calculation,
on his part. But this profit was
only apparent, not real; for he could
not buy any more with the $11,168 in
January, 1910, than he could have
bought with the $10,000 in January,
1909. He is deceived into supposing
himself richer than he really is, and
this false idea leads to a gradual
growth of extravagance and speculation
in every line of business and every
walk of life.</p>

<p>The secondary results of this delusion
of increased wealth because of rising
prices, are even more important
than the primary results. Our grocer,
for example, decides to spend this
$1,168 for an automobile. This helps
the automobile business. Hundreds of
similar orders induce the automobile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
company to enlarge its plant. This
means extensive purchases of material
and employment of labor. The increased
demand resulting from a similar
condition of things in all departments
of industry produces, if other
conditions are favorable, a still further
rise in prices; hence at the end of another
year the grocer perhaps has another
imaginary profit, which he
spends in enlarging his residence or
buying new furniture, etc.</p>

<p>The stock market feels the reflection
of all this increased business and
higher prices. Yet the whole thing is
psychological, and sooner or later our
grocer must earn and save, by hard
work, economical living and shrewd
calculation, the amount he has paid for
his automobile or furniture.</p>

<p>Again, rising stock prices and rising
commodity prices react on each other.
If the grocer, in addition to his imaginary
profit of $1,168 sees a ten per
cent. advance in the prices of various
securities which he holds for investment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
he is encouraged to still larger
expenditures; and likewise if the capitalist
notes a ten per cent. advance in
the stock market, he perhaps employs
additional servants and enlarges his
household expenditures so that he buys
more groceries. Thus the feeling of
confidence and enthusiasm spreads
wider and wider like ripples from a
stone dropped into a pond. And all of
these developments are faithfully reflected
by the stock market barometer.</p>

<p>The result is that, in a year like 1902
or 1906, the high prices for stocks and
the feverish activity of general trade
are based, to an entirely unsuspected
extent, on a sort of pyramid of mistaken
impressions, most of which may
be traced, directly or indirectly, to the
fact that we measure everything in
money and always think of this money-measure
as fixed and unchangeable,
while in reality our money fluctuates
in value just like iron, potatoes, or
“Fruit of the Loom.” We are accustomed
to figuring the money-value of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
wheat, but we get a headache when we
try to reckon the wheat-value of
money.</p>

<p>When a fictitious situation like this
begins to go to pieces, the stock market,
fulfilling its function of barometer,
declines first, while general business
continues active. Then the “money
sharks of Wall Street” get themselves
roundly cursed by the public and there
is a widespread desire to wipe them off
the earth in summary fashion. The
stock market never finds itself popular
unless it is going up; yet its going
down undoubtedly does far more to
promote the country’s welfare in the
long run, for it serves to temper the
crash which must eventually come in
general business circles and to forewarn
us of trouble ahead so that we
may prepare for it.</p>

<p>It is generally more difficult to distinguish
the end of a stock market
boom than to decide when a panic is
definitely over. The principle of the
thing is simple enough, however. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
was an oversupply of liquid capital that
started the market upward after the
panic was over. Similarly it is exhaustion
of liquid capital which brings the
bull movement to an end. This exhaustion
is shown by higher call money
rates, loss of the excess of deposits over
loans in New York clearinghouse
banks, a steady rise in commercial paper
rates, and a sagging market for
high-grade bonds.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VIIThe_Psychology_of_Scale">VII—The Psychology of Scale
Orders</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> observer of market conditions
soon comes to know that there
are two general classes of minds
whose operations are reflected in
prices. These classes might be named
the “impulsive” and the “phlegmatic.”</p>

<p>The “impulsive” operator says, for
example, “Conditions, both fundamental
and technical, warrant higher
prices. Stocks are a purchase.” Having
formed this conclusion, he proceeds
to buy. He does not try or expect to
buy at the bottom. On the contrary
he is perfectly willing to buy at the top
so far, provided he sees prospects of a
further advance. When he concludes
that conditions have turned bearish, or
that the advance in prices has overdiscounted
previous conditions, he sells out.</p>

<p>The “phlegmatic” type of investor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
on the other hand, can hardly ever be
persuaded to buy on an advance. He
reasons, “Prices frequently move several
points against conditions, or at
least against what the conditions seem
to me to be. The sensible thing for me
to do is to take advantage of these contrary
movements.”</p>

<p>Hence when he believes stocks
should be bought he places an order
to buy on a scale. His thought is:</p>

<p>“It seems to me stocks should advance
from these prices, but I am not
a soothsayer, and prices have often
declined three points when I felt just
as bullish as I do now. So I will place
orders to buy every half point down
for three points. These speculators
are a crazy lot and there is no knowing
what passing breeze might strike
them that would cause a temporary decline
of a few points.”</p>

<p>Among large capitalists, and especially
in the banking community, the
“phlegmatic” type naturally predominates.
Such men have neither the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
time nor the disposition to watch the
ticker closely and they nearly always
disclaim any ability to predict the
smaller movements of prices. They
are entirely ready, nevertheless, to take
advantage of these small fluctuations
when they occur, and having plenty of
capital, they can easily accomplish this
by buying or selling on a scale.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the market is
usually full of scale orders, and the
knowledge of this and of the way in
which such orders are handled is decidedly
helpful in judging the tone and
technical position of the market from
day to day.</p>

<p>The two types of operators above
described are always working against
each other. The buying or selling of
the “impulsive” trader tends to force
prices up or down, while the scale orders
of the “phlegmatic” class tend to
oppose any movement.</p>

<p>For example, let us suppose that
banking interests believe conditions to
be fundamentally sound and that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
general trend of the market will be upward
for some time to come. Orders
are therefore placed by various persons
to buy stocks every point down,
or every half, quarter, or even eighth
point down.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the active floor
traders find that, owing to some temporary
unfavorable development, a following
can be obtained on the bear
side. They perceive the presence of
scale orders, but they think stocks enough
will come out on the decline to fill the
scale orders and leave a balance over.</p>

<p>To put it another way, the floating
supply of stocks has become, at the
moment, larger than can comfortably
be tossed about from hand to hand by
the in-and-out class of traders. The
market must decline until a part of this
floating supply is absorbed by the scale
orders which underlie current prices.</p>

<p>These conditions produce what is
commonly called a “reaction.” Once
this surplus floating supply of stocks
is absorbed by standing orders, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
market is ready to start upward again.
If the general trend is upward, far less
resistance will be encountered on the
advance than was met on the reaction;
hence prices rise to a new high level.
Then profit-taking sales will be met,
on limited or scale orders at various
prices, and as the market advances the
floating supply will gradually increase
until it again becomes unwieldy and
another reaction is necessary.</p>

<p>Eventually a level is reached, or
some change in conditions appears,
which causes these scale buying orders
to be partially or entirely withdrawn,
and selling orders to be substituted on
a scale up. The bull market will not
go much further after this change
takes place. It has now become easier
to produce declines than advances.
The situation is the reverse of that described
above, and a bear market follows.</p>

<p>Commonly there is a considerable
period around top prices when scale
buying orders are still found on declines,
but profit-taking sales are also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
met on advances, so that the market is
kept fluctuating within comparatively
narrow limits for a month or more. In
fact, it is likely to be kept on this level
so long as public buying continues
greater than public selling. This is
sometimes called “distribution.” A
similar period of “accumulation” often
occurs after a bear market has run its
course, and before any important advance
appears.</p>

<p>A close watch of transactions, or a
study of continuous quotations as published
in certain newspapers, often enables
the experienced trader to discover
when the most important of these scale
orders are withdrawn or reversed.</p>

<p>A bull market which is full of scale
buying orders encounters “support,”
so-called, on declines. Bears are timid
about driving down prices, because
they are continually “losing their
stocks.” They say that “very little
stock comes out on declines”; hence
there is a certain appearance of caution
in the way the market goes down, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
the activity of trade shows, in a broad
way, a falling off at lower prices. On
the advances, however, a following is
obtained and activity increases.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the bull market
a change is noticeable. Prices go
down easily and on larger transactions,
while advances are sluggish and opposition
is met at higher levels where
profit-taking orders have been placed.
The very day when scale buying orders
in a stock are withdrawn can
oftentimes be distinguished.</p>

<p>In a bear market, “pressure” appears
in place of “support.” The scale orders
are mostly to sell as the market
rises. Only a small following of purchasers
is obtainable on advances,
hence the activity of business, in a general
way, falls off as prices go up.
The end of the bear market is marked
by the reappearance of “support” and
the removal of “pressure,” so that
prices rebound quickly and sharply
from declines.</p>

<p>The common assumption is that this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
“support” or “pressure” is supplied by
“manipulators.” But it is quite as
likely to result from the scale operations
of hundreds of different persons,
whose mental make-up prevents them
from buying or selling in the “impulsive”
way.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VIIIThe_Mental_Attitude_of_the">VIII—The Mental Attitude of the
Individual</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> previous chapters we have seen
that many, if not most, of the eccentricities
of speculative markets,
commonly charged to manipulation,
are in fact due to the peculiar psychological
conditions which surround such
markets. Especially, and more than all
else together, these erratic fluctuations
are the result of the efforts of traders
to operate, not on the basis of facts,
nor on their own judgment as to the
effect of facts on prices, but on what
they believe will be the probable effect
of facts or rumors on the minds of
other traders. This mental attitude
opens up a broad field of conjecture,
which is not limited by any definite
boundaries of fact or common sense.</p>

<p>Yet it would be foolish to assert that
assuming a position in the market
based on what others will do is a wrong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
attitude. It is confusing to the uninitiated,
and first efforts to work on such
a plan are almost certain to be disastrous;
but for the experienced it becomes
a successful, though of course
never a certain, method. A child’s first
efforts to use a sharp tool are likely to
result in bloodshed, but the same tool
may trace an exquisite carving in the
hands of an expert.</p>

<p>What, then, should be the mental attitude
of the intelligent buyer and
seller of securities?</p>

<p>The “long pull” investor, buying outright
for cash and holding for a liberal
profit, need only consider this matter
enough to guard against becoming confused
by the vagaries of public sentiment
or by his own inverted reasoning
processes. He will get the best results
by keeping his eye single to two things:
Facts and Prices. The current rate of
interest, the earning power of the corporations
whose stocks he buys, the
development of political conditions as
affecting invested capital, and the relation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
of current prices to the situation
as shown by these three factors—these
constitute the most important food for
his mind to work upon.</p>

<p>When he finds himself wandering off
into a consideration of what “They”
will do next, or what effect such and
such events may have on the sentiment
of speculators, he cannot do better
than to bring himself up with a short
turn and sternly bid himself “Back to
common sense.”</p>

<p>For the more active trader the situation
is different. He need not be entirely
unregardful of values or fundamental
conditions, but his prime object
is to “go with the tide.” That means
basing his operations to a great extent
on what others will think and do. His
own mental attitude, then, is a most important
part of his equipment for
success.</p>

<p>First, the trader must be a <em>reasoning
optimist</em>. A more horrible fate can
scarcely be imagined than the shallow
pessimism of many market habitués,
whose minds, incapable of grasping the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
larger forces beneath the movements
of prices, take refuge in a cynical disbelief
in pretty much everything that
makes life worth living.</p>

<p>Owing to the nature of the business,
however, this optimism must be of a
somewhat different character from that
which brings success in other lines. As
a general thing optimism includes the
persistent nourishing of hope, an aggressive
confidence, the certainty that
you are right, a firm determination to
accomplish your end. But you cannot
make the stock market move your way
by believing that it will do so. Here
is one case, at any rate, where New
Thought methods cannot be directly
applied.</p>

<p>In the market you are nothing but
a chip on the tide of events. Optimism,
then, must consist in believing, not
that the tide will continually flow your
way, but that you will succeed in floating
with the tide. Your optimism must
be, in a sense, of the intellect, not of
the will. An optimism based on determination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
would, in this case, amount
to stubbornness.</p>

<p>Another quality that makes for success
in nearly every line of business is
enthusiasm. For this you have absolutely
no use in the stock market. The
moment you permit yourself to become
enthusiastic, you are subordinating
your reasoning powers to your beliefs
or desires.</p>

<p>Enthusiasm helps you influence other
men’s minds, but in the market you do
not desire to do this (unless you happen
to be a big bull leader). You wish
to keep your mind as clear, cool and
unruffled as the surface of a mountain
lake on a calm day. Any emotion—enthusiasm,
fear, anger, depression—will
only cloud the intellect.</p>

<p>Doubtless it would be axiomatic to
warn the trader against stubbornness.
It cannot be assumed that any operator
would consciously permit himself to
become stubborn. The trouble arises
in drawing the line between, on the
one hand, persistence, consistence, pursuit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
of a definite plan until conditions
change; and, on the other, stubborn adherence
to a course of action which
subsequent events have proved to be
erroneous.</p>

<p>A day in the country, with the market
forgotten, or if necessary forcibly
ejected from the thoughts, will often
enable the trader to return with a clarified
mind, so that he can then intelligently
convict or acquit himself of the vice of
stubbornness. Sometimes it may become
necessary to close all commitments
and remain out of the market
for a few days.</p>

<p>One of the most common errors
might be described as “getting a notion.”
This is due to the failure or inability
of the trader to take a broad
view of the entire situation. Some
particular point in the complex conditions
which usually control prices, appeals
to him strongly and impresses
him as certain to have its effect on the
market. He acts on this single idea.
The idea may be all right, but other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
counterbalancing factors may prevent
it from having its natural effect.</p>

<p>You encounter these “notions” every
day in the Street. You meet a highly
conservative individual and ask him
what he thinks of the situation. “I am
alarmed at the rapid spread of radical
sentiment,” he replies. “How can we
expect capital to branch out into new
enterprises when the profits may be
swept away at any moment by socialistic
legislation?”</p>

<p>You say mildly that the crops are
good, the banking situation sound, business
active, etc. But all this produces
no impression upon him. He has sold
all his stocks and has his money in the
banks. (He is also short a considerable
line, but he doesn’t tell you this).
He will not buy again until the public
becomes “sane.”</p>

<p>The next man you talk with says:
“We cannot have much decline with
the present good crop prospect. Crops
lie at the basis of everything. With
nine billions of new wealth coming out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
of the ground and flowing into the
channels of trade, we are bound to
have prosperous conditions for some
time to come.”</p>

<p>You speak of radicalism, adverse legislation,
high cost of living, etc.; but
he thinks these are relatively unimportant
compared with that $9,000,000,000
of new wealth. Of course, he
is long of stocks.</p>

<p>“To make the worse appear the better
reason,” said Mr. Socrates, some
little time ago. It is too bad we can’t
have Socrates’ comments on Wall
Street. The Socratic method applied
to the average speculator would produce
amusing results.</p>

<p>Beware of saying, “This is the most
important factor in the situation,” unless
the action of the market shows
that others agree with you. Every
human mind has its own peculiarities,
so presumably yours has, though you
can’t see them plainly; but the stock
market is the meeting of many minds,
having every imaginable peculiarity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
However important some single factor
in the situation may appear to you, it
is not going to control the movement
of prices regardless of everything else.</p>

<p>An exaggerated example of “getting
a notion” is seen in the so-called
“hunch.” This term appears to mean,
when it means anything, a sort of sudden
welling up of instinct so strong as
to induce the trader to follow it regardless
of reason. In many cases, the
“hunch” is nothing more than a strong
impulse.</p>

<p>Almost any business man will say
at times, “I have a feeling that we
ought not to do this,” or “Somehow I
don’t like that proposition,” without
being able to explain clearly the
grounds for his opposition. Likewise the
“hunch” of a man who has watched
the stock market for half a lifetime
may not be without value. In such a
case it doubtless represents an accumulation
of small indications, each so
trifling or so evasive that the trader<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
cannot clearly marshal and review
them even in his own mind.</p>

<p>Only the experienced trader is entitled
to a “hunch.” The novice, or the
man who is not closely in touch with
technical conditions, is merely making
an unusual ass of himself when he
talks about a “hunch.”</p>

<p>The successful trader gradually
learns to study his own psychological
characteristics and allow to some extent
for his customary errors of judgment.
If he finds that he is generally
too hasty in reaching a conclusion, he
learns to wait and reflect further.
After making his decision, he withdraws
it and lays it up on a shelf to
ripen. He makes only a part of his full
commitment at the moment when he
feels most confident, holding the remainder
in reserve.</p>

<p>If he finds that he is usually overcautious,
he eventually learns to be a
little more daring, to buy a part of his
line while his mind is still partially enveloped
in the mists of doubt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>Most of the practical suggestions
which can be offered are necessarily of
a somewhat negative character. We
can point out the errors to be avoided
much more successfully than we can
lay out a course of positive action. But
the following summary may be useful
to the active trader:</p>

<p>(1) Your main purpose must be to
keep the mind clear and well balanced.
Hence, do not act hastily on apparently
sensational information; do not trade
so heavily as to become anxious; and
do not permit yourself to be influenced
by your position in the market.</p>

<p>(2) Act on your own judgment, or
else act absolutely and entirely on the
judgment of another, regardless of
your own opinion. “Too many cooks
spoil the broth.”</p>

<p>(3) When in doubt, keep out of the
market. Delays cost less than losses.</p>

<p>(4) Endeavor to catch the trend of
sentiment. Even if this should be temporarily
against fundamental conditions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
it is nevertheless unprofitable to
oppose it.</p>

<p>(5) The greatest fault of ninety-nine
out of one hundred active traders is
being bullish at high prices and bearish
at low prices. Therefore, refuse to
follow the market beyond what you
consider a reasonable climax, no matter
how large the possible profits that
you may appear to be losing by inaction.</p>

<p>The field covered by these chapters
is to a great extent new. As it becomes
more thoroughly cultivated, it
may be possible to speak with more
scientific definiteness. In the meantime,
the author hopes that his comments
and suggestions may be of some
service in helping readers to avoid unwise
risks and to apply sound principles
of analysis to the investment or
speculative situation.</p>
